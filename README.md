Repository of Test Reference Results for TAPAS PhysIO Toolbox
==============================================================

Please note: If you are not a PhysIO developer or trying to debug PhysIO functionality, this is probably not the repository you are looking for. The example files to try out the toolbox are in the [PhysIO Examples Repository](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO-Examples)

In this repository, you can find all reference results for unit and integration tests for the [TAPAS PhysIO Toolbox](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO). You can download the reference results by cloning this repository as

```
git clone https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO-Test-Reference-Results.git PhysIO/test-reference-results 
```

The general folder structure for the PhysIO repositories should be as follows:

```
PhysIO                     
|
|-> examples              
|
|-> test-reference-results 
```

where:

- `PhysIO` is your PhysIO code repository, code cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO) or release downloaded and unzipped from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15578837)
- `PhysIO/examples` is your PhysIO examples repository, code and data cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO-Examples) or release downloaded and unzipped from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15579087)
- `PhysIO/test-reference-results` is your PhysIO reference results repository, data cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/ComputationalPsychiatry/PhysIO-Test=Reference-Results) or release downloaded and unzipped from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/16579519)
